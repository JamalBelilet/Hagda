# Daily Brief Improvements - Feature Enhancement Brainstorm

## Overview
Based on the current implementation screenshots, this document outlines potential improvements to enhance the Daily Brief feature's usability, visual appeal, and functionality.

## Current State Analysis

### What's Working
- Clean, minimalist design with clear section headers
- Brief metadata (story count, read time, mode)
- Collapsed/expanded view toggle functionality
- Integration with the main feed structure
- "Top story from your sources" labeling

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Visual Hierarchy**: All articles look identical with same styling
2. **Source Attribution**: Limited visual distinction between sources
3. **Content Preview**: Collapsed view shows minimal information
4. **Engagement Metrics**: No indication of article popularity or relevance
5. **Time Context**: Articles show relative time but lack today's context emphasis
6. **Mode Selection**: "Standard Brief" mode not visually accessible for changing
