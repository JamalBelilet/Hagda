# Privacy Policy for Hagda

**Last Updated: May 23, 2025**

## Overview

Hagda ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our iOS application.

## Information Collection and Use

### What We Don't Collect

Hagda is designed with privacy in mind. We do **NOT** collect, store, or transmit:
- Personal identification information
- Device identifiers
- Location data
- Contact information
- Usage analytics
- Crash reports (unless you explicitly opt-in)

### What Happens On Your Device

All your preferences and settings in Hagda are stored locally on your device:
- Selected content sources
- Reading preferences
- Content progress
- Daily brief settings

This data never leaves your device and is not accessible to us.

### Third-Party Services

Hagda fetches content from public APIs of the services you choose to follow:
- Reddit (public API)
- Bluesky (public API)
- Mastodon (public API)
- RSS feeds for news and podcasts

When fetching content:
- We only access publicly available content
- No authentication credentials are stored
- Requests include a generic User-Agent header ("Hagda/1.0")
- Your IP address may be visible to these services (as with any internet request)

## Data Storage

- All data is stored locally using iOS's secure storage mechanisms
- No data is transmitted to our servers (we don't have any)
- Content is cached temporarily for offline reading
- You can clear all app data by deleting the app

## Data Sharing

We do not share any data because we don't collect any data.

## Children's Privacy

Hagda does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. The app displays content from public sources which may not be suitable for children.

## Security

Your data security is important to us:
- All network requests use secure HTTPS connections
- Minimum TLS 1.2 is enforced
- No sensitive data is transmitted
- Local data is protected by iOS security features

## Your Rights

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control:
- **Access**: All your data is in the app
- **Deletion**: Delete the app to remove all data
- **Portability**: Your data stays on your device
- **Correction**: Change any preferences directly in the app

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be noted with an updated "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## California Privacy Rights

California residents have specific rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Since we don't collect personal information, these rights are inherently respected.

## European Privacy Rights

For users in the European Economic Area (EEA), we comply with GDPR requirements. Since we don't collect or process personal data, we are not a data controller or processor under GDPR.
